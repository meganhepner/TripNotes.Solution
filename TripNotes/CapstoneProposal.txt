What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
-C#/.NET
-ASP.NET MVC Core
-Entity
-MySql
-Chart.js
-Bootstrap
-probably some JavaScript/Blazer?

-Pace calculations can be picked up from past performances to compare horses in a future race
-App highlights positive indicators in pace comparisons

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
